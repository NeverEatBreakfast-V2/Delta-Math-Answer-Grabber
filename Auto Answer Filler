# This code does the following:

1. Checks if the current page is a problem set page by checking the URL.
2. Waits for the page to fully load before proceeding.
3. Selects all the problem elements on the page using querySelectorAll().
4. Loops through each problem and extracts the answer input field.
5. Calls the getCorrectAnswer() function to extract the correct answer from the problem statement.
6. Fills in the answer input field with the correct answer.

WARNING: YOU MUST MANUALLY FILL OUT WHAT SEARCH ENGINE YOU WILL USE OR IT DOES NOT WORK :P
